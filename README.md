AgroRepro
**AgroRepro** tackles the lack of reproducibility and structure in agricultural research workflows, 
where experiments are often tracked using disorganized spreadsheets or handwritten notes. 
The project aims to build a modular R-based toolkit that helps researchers design experiments, manage inputs, 
collect data, analyze results, and generate reproducible, version-controlled reportsâ€”bringing rigor and 
transparency to how agricultural experiments are planned, executed, and shared.
