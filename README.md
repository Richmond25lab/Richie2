1. AgroRepro
**AgroRepro** tackles the lack of reproducibility and structure in agricultural research workflows, 
where experiments are often tracked using disorganized spreadsheets or handwritten notes. 
The project aims to build a modular R-based toolkit that helps researchers design experiments, manage inputs, 
collect data, analyze results, and generate reproducible, version-controlled reportsâ€”bringing rigor and 
transparency to how agricultural experiments are planned, executed, and shared.

2. Advanced Data Analysis App
This Shiny script creates an interactive **R-based web app** for advanced data analysis, allowing users to upload a dataset (CSV or Excel), choose variables, and run **statistical tests** (Shapiro-Wilk for normality, t-test, ANOVA) and **visualizations** (boxplots, scatterplots, regression, histograms, etc.). It dynamically adjusts the UI based on analysis type (single vs. comparative), renders data previews and plots, and lets users **download a report** summarizing the results. It's designed with a user-friendly layout and customizable graph labeling, ideal for researchers who need fast, flexible, and reproducible analysis without coding.
