1. AgroRepro
**AgroRepro** tackles the lack of reproducibility and structure in agricultural research workflows, 
where experiments are often tracked using disorganized spreadsheets or handwritten notes. 
The project aims to build a modular R-based toolkit that helps researchers design experiments, manage inputs, 
collect data, analyze results, and generate reproducible, version-controlled reports—bringing rigor and 
transparency to how agricultural experiments are planned, executed, and shared.

2. Image renaming app
  This Shiny app is a **photo upload and renaming tool** designed for my undergraduate project. It lets users:

1. **Upload multiple images** (JPEG, PNG, HEIC).
2. **Convert HEIC files** to JPEG automatically using the `magick` package.
3. **Rename all uploaded images** using a custom base name (e.g., “photo\_1.jpeg”, “photo\_2.jpeg”, etc.).
4. **Download the renamed photos** as a ZIP archive.

The app has a clean UI with two tabs—**Upload Photos** and **Rename Photos**—and handles common file management tasks with notifications for success or errors. It's especially useful for organizing large batches of images with consistent, readable names.
